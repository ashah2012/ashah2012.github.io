To unstagae files, files are only unstagged at this moment, but still present.
```
git reset <file-name>
```

We may want to go back to previous state, we will go back to place where, when last commit took place
```
git checkout -- <file-name>
```
checkout takes us back to the point mentioned as argument.


## Branching Basics
You may need to work on a bug or a new feature and you'd like to work on a separate branch out the main branch. So that, if anything goes wrong you can easily go back to previous stable state.


```
git branch <branch-name>
```
Creates a branch named - branch-name

```
git branch
```
Lists all the branches and points out the current branch with *.

To, move from current branch to one of the feature branch listed, use the following comman. 
```
git checkout <branch-name>
```


## Merging Basics

To merge the changes from current branch, switch back to master first. 
```
git checkout master
```
Then, to merge -
```
git merge <branch-name>
```

You might want to delete the branch after merging. 
```
git branch -d <branch-name>
```

In the next article we would see how to clone, rebase and other important stuffs.
