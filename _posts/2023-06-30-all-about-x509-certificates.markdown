# What are X509 Certificates?
Certificates are digital certificate which holds value when it is issued by a trusted authority. For example - A driving license which is issued by the government is valid across the country because it was issued by a trusted authority, in this case, it's the government. But if I create a license on a piece of paper and issue it to my friend, can he use it for good purpose? No, because nobody knows me and I am not a trusted by anybody. 
But it can work, if the government trusts me, then I can issue a driving license because the police/ people trusts the government and in turn the government trusts me with issueing the licenses. 

So, digital certificates are :
- Proof of Identity
- Serves a purpose
- Issuer - is trusted
