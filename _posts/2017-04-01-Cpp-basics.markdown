Git is now de facto version control system. Everybody is using GIT, and if you aren't, then it's time that you should start using it too. 
I'll cover few basic git commands in this article and more advance commands in the next article. Frankly, there is no advance commands, just little lazy to write it tonight. 

Here we go,

```
$ mkdir git-demo
$ cd git-demo
/git-demo$ git init
```
Initializes the current directory as git repository. 

```
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/avishek/git-demo/.git/
```
