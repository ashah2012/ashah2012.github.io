[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a sensation now. It was little difficult for me six months ago to understand why Docker was created? Isn't Docker the 20th solution to the previous 19th solution for software shipment? VMs already existed! It would not be fair to point out the advantages of Docker in a single article. I'll give it a due share of credit in articles to come, and honestly, the more I've clear and concise advantages of it.

## So What is Docker?

Docker is something that has become the standard for developers and system admins for packing, shipping and deploying applications. The developers create a template called **docker image** and Docker creates a **container**.

Image also referred as **Dockerfile** contains instruction for creating a new image entirely or from an existing image. 

We can also share our new image with the world, via [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). We just need to upload the new image to the Docker repository which is similar to Git Push. One great added advantage here is, that uploading the new image will not much of your time, since the original image is already with Docker repository, it will only upload the differences and Docker will manage on its own.   

Docker makes it easier for the teams to automate infrastructure, isolate code. And maintain consistency.

Docker can be easily installed in Linux, Mac and Windows. Head over to Docker site and read the instructions carefully for installing it. Next I'll discuss about the installation in Linux.

## Installing Docker in Linux!

In the next article I will my experience's installing Docker in Ubuntu.
