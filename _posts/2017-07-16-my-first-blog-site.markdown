I created this blog site in under 5 minutes. Well technically little more than that.There were issues which had to be sorted out and googled. So if you're looking to create a blog site for yourself or want to help your developer friends, then this is what you were looking for.

There are numerous options, WordPress being the most popular among all. I can't say why I didn't choose WordPress, may be, I didn't find any simple template like the one I'm using here? How's that for starters? And I would be happy to tell you, I'm using the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) template while writing this post. Sure, I have plans in future to change the template.

Getting back to the point. This page is hosted at [Github](https://pages.github.com/) and the domain name is purchased from [G Suite](https://gsuite.google.com).

## Set up

 * Ruby - install Ruby, there are various guides available to install on all the three platforms.
 * Jekyll - head over [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site, read the documentation about setting up and writing posts.
 * Github account.
 * Custom domain names.
 * You should know what you're doing.

## First Step

Create a repository at github. Name the repository *username.github.io*. Clone the repository to your local system.
Create an index.html file and just write few lines (this is just for testing the setup). A `Hello World` would be fine. Commit the changes and push them over to your repository.
Your index.html file should be hosted at *username.github.io*. Fire up your favourite browser and enter the URL. And see for yourself.

## Second Step - Setting up Jekyll!

If you have Ruby installed properly then you're almost done installing Jekyll.
Just run `gem install jekyll bundler`. And you're done.
Create a new blog at the repository folder by running the command `jekyll new my-awesome-site`. This will create a new Jekyll site. Commit your changes and push them over. If you visit your Github pages url again, you will see the new blog site generated by Jekyll.
Read full Jekyll [documentation here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) about creating posts and managing your site.

```bash
gem install jekyll bundler

jekyll new my-awesome-site

cd my-awesome-site

bundle exec jekyll serve

# => Now browse to http://localhost:4000

```

## Final Step - Domain name set up!

Github pages provide a lot of way to set your domain and make your *username.github.io* available at your domain name specified. You can set A, ALIAS, ANAME record at your name provider directing to URL *username.github.io* or to the ip provided by Github pages. A full step by step guide can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/).


## Comment Section

I've added the comment section on 20th July, 2017, using [Disqus](https://disqus.com/). It's fairly simple to add a comment section from Disqus, just add the short-name from disqus to **_config.yml**.

Hope, you all like this article. If you need any help twitter me!
Have a good day.
