I live in Indian state of Kolkata. I have been working professionally for more than 5 years now. I am Java backend developer with some experience in Big Data tools as well.

## Do I work ?.

I work for a US based software company, and have been developing software for clients who are based in Europe. 

## What else do I do ? 

Movies and riding my motor bike are my favourite thing to do when I am not consumed by my work. 
I am currently watching Dark on Netflix.
I own 2017 model KTM Duke 200, I use it for my everyday commute and occassionally take it for a long road trip.

## What can I do?

Well I can create applications mainly written in Java, and :

* Use **SpringBoot** (as my favourite microservice enabler) to create small apps quickly. I also created a monolith application using Spring Boot recently.
* Use **Docker**, containerize applications.
* Use **Apache Kafka** for streaming systems.
* Use **Kafka Streams** and **Apache Storm** for stream processing.
* Use **AppDynamics** for figuring out any possible bottlenecks in applications.
* Write shell and Powershell scripts.


## Things currently I am looking into

There are always a lot of things that amuse me and want to learn them all. But right now I am focussed on these topics :

* **Docker Swarm and Kubernetes** - really want to be a good at this.
* **Scaling SpringBoot Applications** - if you can't scale them up, then why use them?

## Do I work as freelance

Well yes, I do also take up projects and work freelance, unless their is no compflict of interest in my work, it okay for me to stretch and work for long hours.
