I live in Kolkata(Ind). When I was a kid I was greatly amused by computers and how awesome were the games that were available on them to play. I have always wanted to be a game creator so I started learning Java. But reality hit me hard, it takes more than being a good coder to be a game developer. 

## Do I work ?

I am currently work at [Cognizant Technology Solutions](https://www.cognizant.com/).

I have been developing software for clients who are Banking Majors for the last three and half years. I am currently working on a solution which automates my client's applications so that it can be monitored by [AppDynamics](https://www.appdynamics.com/). 

## What else do I do ? 

Movies and riding my motor bike are my favourite thing to do when I am not consumed by my work. 

## What can I do?

Well I can create applications mainly written in Java, and :

* Use **SpringBoot** (as my favourite microservice enabler) to create small apps quickly.
* Use **Docker** to ship it without hassles.
* Use **Apache Kafka** as my messaging system. There's a lot which we can achieve with Kafka. (Well you must read [this](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-scale-microservices-with-message-queues-spring-boot-and-kubernetes-f691b7ba3acf), it's half way tl;dr).
* Use **Apache Storm** for real time analysis.
* Use **AppDynamics** for figuring out any possible bottlenecks in applications.


## Things currently I am looking into

There are always a lot of things that amuse me and want to learn them all. But right now I am focussed on these topics :

* **Docker Swarm and Kubernetes** - really want to be a good at this.
* **Scaling SpringBoot Applications** - if you can't scale them up, then why use them?
